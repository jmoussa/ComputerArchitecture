*Best effort hash table*

Memory System:
    Different memories exist at different levels of the computer
    Each var in their speed, size and cost

RAM:
    RAM is packaged as a chip
    Basic unit is a cell (1 bit per cell)

Static RAM: (caches)
    Each cell stores bit with a 6-transistor circuit
    Retain value indefinitely
    Faster and more expensive than Dynamic RAM (DRAM)

Dynamic RAM:
    Each cell stores bit with a capacitor and transistor
    Value must be refreshed 10-100ms
    Sensitive to disturbances
    Slower and cheaper than Static RAM (SRAM)

Any program that is executing, needs to be run in Memory/RAM (NOT DISK)

Cache Memories                        |
---------------------------------------
Small, fast SRAM-based memories managed automatically in hardware
    -Hold frequently accessed blocks of main memory
    -Sits much closer to processor than RAM/DRAM
    -CPU searches through L1, L2 then RAM

Locality
------------------
Memory references are bunched together
    -A small portion of address space is accessed at any given

Temporal Locality- Most frequently accessed locations over time
Spatial Locality- Accesses locations close to each other

Addresses the gap b/n CPU and RAM speed
Small high speed memory can make computer faster and cheaper
